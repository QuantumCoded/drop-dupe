# drop-dupe
This is a program used to brute force remove duplicate frames from video.
I intend to add support for smarter and less time consuming methods for removing duplicate frames in the future.

## setup
In order to run this program you must have a copy of `ffmpeg.exe` pathed.
ffmpeg can be downloaded [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
